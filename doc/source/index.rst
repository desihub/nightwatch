Nightwatch is a Python package that generates and displays realtime quality
assurance (QA) metrics for nightly DESI observing shifts. It calculates metrics
at the level of individual DESI fibers, CCD amplifiers, CCD cameras, and
spectrographs.

DESI observing shifters can see QA from DESI shifts posted on the `main
Nightwatch website at NERSC <https://nightwatch.desi.lbl.gov/nights.html>`_.
