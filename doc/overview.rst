Nightwatch is a program designed to provide realtime DESI data quality monitoring. The software runs at KPNO and NERSC and splits its work into three steps:

#. Process exposure data as they are recorded on disk.

#. Compute quality assurance (QA) metrics for the data.

#. Generate plots and HTML pages to display the QA results for monitoring by DESI observers.
