# Threshold files

This directory contains files defining the acceptable thresholds for various
QA metrics.  Most are placeholders, but the READNOISE*.json thresholds are
meaningful.

## READNOISE

Read noise thresholds are calculated separately for ZEROs vs. longer ("DARK")
exposures since the B-camera CCDs have a short- vs. long- exptime readnoise
dependence (though this difference has been much reduced in the latest
timing files as of 20210128).

Readnoise thresholds are calculated by providing and input file of
NIGHT EXPID to use and a directory of previously processed nightwatch data.
Two example nightexpid files are provided as examples, but future updates
do not need to keep the equivalent files since the json outputs also contain
the list of exposures used.

Example:
```
python calcnominalreadnoise.py \
    --indir /global/cfs/cdirs/desi/spectro/nightwatch/nersc \
    --nightexpids 20210128-ZERO.txt \
    --outfile READNOISE-20210128-ZERO.json

python calcnominalreadnoise.py \
    --indir /global/cfs/cdirs/desi/spectro/nightwatch/nersc \
    --nightexpids 20210128-DARK.txt \
    --outfile READNOISE-20210128-DARK.json
```
